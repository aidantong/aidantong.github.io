            <p class="about">Hello! My name’s Aidan and I'm a junior studying computer science at UC Berkeley. I’m originally from Hong Kong, but came to the US a couple years ago for college. I love programming and teaching, so you’ll catch me doing a bit of both at Berkeley.</p>
            <p class="about">I had the opportunity of interning at Salesforce this past summer, where I got the chance to work on some security-related projects. In general, I’m fascinated by any and all topics--my first CS course was at Berkeley, so I haven’t really had the chance to carve out a niche yet.</p>
            <p class="about">A few personal notes: my favorite sport is soccer, although we call it “football” where I come from (also the rest of the world, but I digress). I actually spent a good number of my middle and high school years playing for the Hong Kong National Football Team, which was pretty cool. I’m also left-handed, but that only holds true for eating and writing--I throw and hold rackets with my right. Another fun fact: I have 3 brothers, and housing isn’t cheap in both HK and the Bay Area, so I’ve never had my own room (excited to graduate and hopefully get my own room). I also have a dog named Tofu.</p>
            <p class="about">I think I’m a pretty cool guy, so feel free to get in touch! My contact info is below and here's my <a href="assets/docs/Aidan_Tong_Resume.pdf" id="resume" target="_blank">resume</a>.</p>
